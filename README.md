Welcome to **Tic Tac Toe** — a simple and interactive 2-player game developed using basic Python! This was created as part of a semester project to showcase fundamental programming concepts like conditionals, loops, string formatting, user interaction, and control flow.

🧠 How It Works

- Two players are prompted to enter their names.
- A coin toss (heads/tails) determines which player will go first.
- Player 1 uses **X**, and Player 2 uses **O**.
- The board is labeled 1–9 for ease of input.
- Players take alternate turns entering the number where they want to place their symbol.
- After each move, the board is updated and displayed.
- A winner is declared as soon as one player aligns 3 symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
- If no one wins after 9 moves, it's a draw!

🛠️ Features

- ✅ **Interactive Command Line Interface**  
- 🎲 **Random Toss Logic** for fair first turn decision  
- 👥 **2-Player Mode** with clear symbol allocation  
- ♻️ **Real-Time Board Updates**  
- 🧩 **Win Condition Check After Every Move**  
- 🚫 **Prevents Overwriting Symbols** (can be enhanced further)

🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `random` and `math` libraries for toss logic
- String manipulation and control structures for gameplay logic

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-python.git
cd tic-tac-toe-python

2. Run the game

python tic_tac_toe.py



💡 Future Improvements (for devs)

Prevent invalid or already-taken inputs

Add AI opponent mode using Minimax algorithm

Include score tracking or replay option

Use OOP for better structure (e.g., Game, Player, Board classes)

Create a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt
